<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>
   
<p align="center">   
   A simple Chat developed with Flutter 💙 and Firebase 💛.<br>
   With this application you can chat with people, acessing it via your Google Account, sending and receiving messages and photos, and entering different accounts with each message you send.
   As a backend, I used Firebase, noSQL and in real time, which gives you flexibility, easy development, manipulation and structuring, you can see more on the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase Website</a>.<br>
   This application is in version 2.0.0, using Flutter 3.7.0 and latest versions of all dependencies.

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

   <p>
    This application was very challenging for me, but it was very good for my learning about backend, and I loved this experience of developing one on Firebase, which I had heard about, but never created anything, and I was so impressed functionality!<br>
    All these moments of problems only increased my interest in this incredible world of programming, which I hope to secceed and stay focused on, I am loving it! Is sensational!<br>
    Another challenge I faced was updating the project. Because it had been coded 3 years ago, and the update was not that simple. It was a cool experience and one that brought me good learnings.
